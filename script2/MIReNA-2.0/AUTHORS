MIReNA software has been developed by Anthony Mathelier and Alessandra Carbone.

It uses modified source codes from the ViennaRNA package developped by I.
Hofacker, P. Stadler, W. Fontana and S. Wuchty (in the folding/ repository),
from an Approximate String Matching algorithm developped by G. Myers (in the
asml/ repository) and from the miRDeep package developped by Marc Friedl√§nder
and Nikolaus Rajewsky (the fromDeepSeq/dicer_processing.pl file). Finally, scripts
coming from the miRDeep package are used (in the miRDeep/ repository).
