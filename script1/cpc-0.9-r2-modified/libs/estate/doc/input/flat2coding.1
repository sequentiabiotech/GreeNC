flat2coding \- Extract coding sequences from a EMBL/GenBank database.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B flat2coding
[ -hvc ] [ -do ] <EMBL/GenBank flat file>
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR flat2coding
parses the annotations and feature table from a EMBL or GenBank
format sequence database, to reconstruct coding sequences.
The coding sequences are written to
.I stdout
in FASTA format.

Sequences annotated as being hypothetical, organelle derived,
partial, potential, or putative are discarded.  Any sequences
containing ambiguity codes or not starting with an initiation
codon and ending with an in-frame stop codon are considered
to be poor quality, and are also discarded.

.SH OPTIONS
.\"
.TP
.BI "\-d \--database " sequence-database
Specify the EMBL or GenBank format sequence database.
.\"
.TP
.BI "\-o \--organism " organism-name
Name of the organism
.I exactly
as it appears in the database on the OS line in EMBL
annotation or the ORGANISM line in GenBank annotations.

.SH EXAMPLES
.\"
.B "flat2coding \-o 'Homo sapiens (human)' \-d embl_hum.dat "
.B "> coding.fasta"
.RS
Extract coding sequences from
.IR embl_hum ,
and writes them to
.IR coding.fasta .
This is often used prior to calculation
codon or hexamer frequency statistics, with
.BR "fasta2usage(1)" .
