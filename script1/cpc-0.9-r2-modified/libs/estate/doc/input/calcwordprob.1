calcwordprob \- Generate log-odds probabilities from word counts.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B calcwordprob
[-w ]
<wordcount-file>
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR calcwordprob
takes input a list of word frequencies as generated by
.BR "fasta2usage (1)"
and converts it to a set of log-odds probabilities.
In addition, probabilities are estimated for all
possible words derived from this set containing the ambiguity code,
.IR 'N' .
The output of this program is written to
.IR stdout .
.SH OPTIONS
.\"
.TP
.BI "\-w \--wordprob " wordcount-file
Specifies the input file, which should be output from
.BR "fasta2usage (1)"

.SH EXAMPLES
.B "calcwordprob \-w emblhuman.wordcount > emblhuman.wordprob"
.RS
In this example, a word count file,
.I  emblhuman.wordcount
is generated by
.BR "fasta2usage (1)"
and is used to generate the word probability file,
.I emblhuman.wordprob
which can then be used by
.BR "framefinder (1)".
