.SH NAME
.\"
vpsearch \- sublinear time database searching using a vptree.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vpsearch
[ -hvc ] [ -iq ]
<vpbuild index path> <query sequence path>
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR vpsearch
searches a sequence database in sublinear time
using a vantage point tree built with
.B vpbuild (1)

Each sequence is considered as a point in a general metric
space, and a vantage point tree is used to search the sequences,
by exploitation of the triangle inequality property of the metric
used for the pairwise comparisons between the sequences.

An A*-search is used to allow the results to be reported as
as their position in the hit list can be confirmed.
.SH OPTIONS
.\"
.TP
.BI "\-i \--index " index-path
Specify path for the index as generated by
.B vpbuild (1)
.
.\"
.TP
.BI "\-q \--query " query-sequence-path
Specify a path to the query sequence.
.B edit
distance between
the sequences, or a
.B word
based metric.
.\"
.TP
.BI "\-w \--wordlen " word-length
If the word-based metric is used, this option can
be used to specify the word length which will be used.
.\"
.SH EXAMPLES
.\"
.B "vpsearch -i test.index -q query.fasta"
.RS
This will run vpsearch on the index test.index,
using query.fasta as the query sequence.
.\"
.SH CAVEATS
.RE
The performance of this algorithm on real sequence data
is too low for it to be of practical value.
It is included in this package for interest purposes only.
